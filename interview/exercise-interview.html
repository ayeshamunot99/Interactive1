        <h2> Bio </h2><br>

        <p>My name is Chenyu Zhang, go by Leona. I’m 20 years old. I’m from China. Graphic design major, sophomore at CCA. <br>
            I love for 2D art and packaging. I lean towards working on Photoshop, as I like working with images/ pictures <br>
            and editing them rather than working with typography, text, etc. In the future, I want to work independently back <br>
            home in China, as I feel like I want to make improvements in design aspects there. People aren’t willing to pay as <br>
            much for design, and make design there more important and prominent.

<br>

        <p><strong> 1.	What is ‘good’ screen-based design according to you?</strong></p>

            <p> I prefer doing analogue first and then developing it online on the respective program.</p> <br>

        <p><strong>2.	How is art-making online different then art-making offline? </strong></p>

            <p>Art-making online feels unreal, however, it’s faster and more professional which makes it more perfect. I like that its freer and has a personal touch to it.</p> <br>

        <p><strong>3.	What do you think is the ‘purpose(s)’ of the web? </strong></p>

            <p>I think that it’s a new way of human life. It has become hard to live without it because everyone around us is doing so. </p><br>

        <p><strong> 4.	How has your view of the internet / how you experience being online changed over time?</strong></p>   

            <p>Feels like it’s all so unpredictable and fast. Although I appreciate technology advancement, it feels like there’s no privacy now compared to before. It also
            lacks reality. </p><br>

        <p><strong> 5.	How has your view of the internet / how you experience being online changed over time?</strong></p>  
        
                <p> Feels like it’s all so unpredictable and fast. Although I appreciate technology advancement, it feels like there’s no privacy now compared to before. It also
                    lacks reality.</p><br>

        <p><strong>6.	How does the web impact graphic design? </strong></p>   
        
                    <p>Well, for instance we buy more products online nowadays. I believe online shopping is popular, easy and more comfortable now. Graphic design has to follow <br>
                         people’s lifestyle. Web also impacts graphic design as it is futuristic, for example: animations attached to e-mails are so cute and capturing.</p><br>
        
        <p><strong>7.	Are there any websites with designs that you like? </strong></p>    
        
        <p>I always Consider feedback. I make only 50 percent of the changes if I don’t fully agree with the feedback. If I do agree I will make as many changes as I can. <br>
            For instance, if a person has a different aesthetic, I will make changes to improve but not 100 percent follow it.
